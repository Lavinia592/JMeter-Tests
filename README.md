# JMeter-Tests

I made some basic performance tests on different websites. 

For each test I added Number of Threads (between 1-5), Config Elements (HTTP Cookie Manager, HTTP Requets and HTTP Caache Manager) and Listeners (View Results Tree, Summary Report, Aggregate Graph, Assertion Results and Response Assertion).
